# Advent of Code ‚≠ê

This repo contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2023 and onward. It uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/)!

I didn't make a repo for 2021, but 2022 can be found [here](https://github.com/vegeta897/aoc2022)

To solve a new day:

1. Copy the contents of `/template` to `/YYYY/DD`
2. Copy your puzzle input into input.txt
3. Run `bun test --watch YYYY/DD`
4. (Un)comment lines in the test file as needed.

_Repo structure inspired by [itswil's template](https://github.com/itswil/advent-of-code/)_
