Very fun one, and I did pretty well (rank #642).

For several minutes I was paginating my results manually, and manically scrolling through the console. Then I decided that could take forever, so I just logged a ton of maps to a text file, and `ctrl+f`ed for what I suspected would distinguish the tree from the noise.
