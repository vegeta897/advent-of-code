This was my biggest blunder so far this year. I went down a very unnecessary rabbit hole of building a node graph out of the map because I didn't realize my pathfinder in part 2 was looping. My pathfinder in part 1 worked great, and I could have adapted it just fine to find all paths, but I stupidly thought I had to rewrite it.

After getting my part 2 answer, I rewrote my solution to use the node graph since it's a lot faster, and found along the way 2 issues with my graph building involving multiple paths between nodes, and nodes that lead to themselves.
