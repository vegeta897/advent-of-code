Rank #582! Very happy with today because I did not know if my approach would work at all. At first it seemed like it really wasn't going to, but then I flipped the numbers I was returning in my sort function and it just worked like magic!

Even better, the sorting I did in part 1 turned out to be all that was needed for part 2!
