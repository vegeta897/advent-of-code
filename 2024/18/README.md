Well this was unexpectedly easy. I might have stood a chance at a really nice rank if I had a suitable pathfinding function ready to go. I've done a lot of pathfinding in the past, but for some reason I can never find a suitable-enough one to use without a lot of rewriting.

I was expecting some temporal pathfinding action, like the snowstorm problem in a previous year. But this was totally static! Even before any optimization, part 2 ran in just over 4 seconds. With a single optimization, that cut down to 124ms!

Then my AOC-buddy DoubleDonkey in the NXL server proposed an even simpler solution, so I'm going to rewrite using that after my initial commit.
