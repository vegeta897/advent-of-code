Heck yeah, rank 341!

My part 1 solution was pretty good, but it had to change for part 2 which turned out even better, and was even reusable for part 1 with a simple number change. I feel really smart for figuring out a simple solution like this so quickly.

I could replace the initial pathfinder with something more performant since it's a single-path maze, but whatever.
