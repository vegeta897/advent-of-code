Okay, pretty easy! Very satisfied that my part 2 solution worked without a hitch. It didn't take much thought! I only stumbled in part 1 a bit from a typo.

Update: I even made it more complicated than it needed to be! I figured I would have to find the smallest whole-number portion of each diff, but there's no call for that in the input data.
