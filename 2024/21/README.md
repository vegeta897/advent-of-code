Well this was hell! Took me until 10pm the next night (with sleep and breaks between of course).

I had an inkling of what to do before I went to bed, but it still took me a long time. The real devious part was getting the proper arrow orders, which I had to look up some guidance on. I knew the first night that they mattered, but I had a hard time working out which ones were best.

My code's quite a mess, but I don't feel like cleaning it up.
