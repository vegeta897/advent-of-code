Pretty easy recursive/cache problem. Got delayed in part 1 from a stupid cache design mistake that happened to work for the example input.

~~I have to use 2 caches in part 2 and I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't just work with the `countCache`.~~

Update: Once again, a caching mistake. Now it's just one cache in part 2.
