Stumbled in part 1 with the directionality checking, and then completely stalled for a while in part 2 after failing my first naive attempt.

If there's a more elegant way of doing this than trying each mutation in sequence, then it is beyond me and definitely wouldn't make a difference in runtime, considering how short these reports are and how simple the verification.
