This wasn't as bad as I was expecting for a day 7 Friday, but I was slow and silly. Instead of going for a recursive function (which I will commit afterwards), I decided to iterate the number of possible equations and use bitwise operations to determine the operation for each factor. This worked fine for part 1, but for part 2 I couldn't figure out how to handle 3 states for each bit so I used 2 bits, which meant there was a lot of redundancy, and it pushed the runtime to over 30 seconds.
