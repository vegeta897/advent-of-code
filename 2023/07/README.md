Very fun one! Happy with my ranks (#990 and #1009), though I got delayed at the end of part 2 when I realized I shouldn't have been modifying the original hand when finding the best joker substitutes. That ended up with a lot of identical hands, and I was frantically looking for the rules on handling those in the instructions.

I'm happy with the method I came up with for determining the "n-of-a-kind" for a hand.
