Pretty fun one. Things became much easier when I decided to built a 2D array for "by row" and "by column" separately. That way the exact same mirror logic can be used on both maps.

Part 2 seemed, for a moment, like it was going to be a brute force permutations thing again. But then I realized it was just a matter of counting the differences for the reflection.

I'm heading back into day 12.
