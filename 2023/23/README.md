Pretty straightforward part 1, and a part 2 that I spent too long not doing what I had to do.

My part 2 runs in 13 seconds and I'm trying to implement caching that improves that time, but so far it just increases it.

I could adapt my part 2 solution to part 1 but I don't feel like it.

Update: Replacing the visited nodes set with an array cut the run time in half. Sets aren't as performant as I thought? Still no cache luck. But I have another idea to try.
