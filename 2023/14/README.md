After my day 12 experience, caching seemed like the best approach for part 2 here. But even with multiple layers of caching and every map state becoming fully cached after a few seconds, the example alone was taking more than a few minutes to finish.

I had suspected from the start that the map would fall into a cycle, but was too lazy to explore that. Eventually I had to, and after a lot of hacky code I reached a fast solution.

I don't really feel like cleaning up that hacky code right now.
