Kind of tricky for the first day! Part 1 was a walk, but part 2 brought out an ugly solution from me. Had a little stumble with forgetting to update the digitIndex. Some refactorting was done after solving, but I'm leaving the repetitive first/last code there.

Rank #890 on day 1 seems pretty good though? Better than my previous years.

My friend ran into every possible footgun that I was either lucky to avoid, or have developed some good instincts. His code did have a neat idea for storing digit indexes that made my code much cleaner after including that refactor.
