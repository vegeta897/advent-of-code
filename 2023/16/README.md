I was expecting a jump in difficulty based on a graph someone posted of previous years almost always jumping in difficulty on this day. But it was pretty easy! I'm relieved that the different grid symbols were much easier to code "behavior" for than in the pipe puzzle.

I feel good about my solution. Part 2 was kind of a gimme too if you just brute force it, which takes less than half a second. Though I can definitely see how you can use caching to speed that up!

Rank #1048, woo!
