Not a happy day. Part 1 was kind of fun, coding the permutation function. But no matter how much optimization I tried in part 2, I couldn't get iteration time to be fast enough. I had a brute force running for at least 12 hours that barely made it 1/3 of the way through the full input. I will have to come back to this and figure out how to cache/memoize, and/or optimize some other way.

Update: Woo! My first cache strategy worked astoundingly well after squashing some bugs. Brought my solve time down from days to less than 200ms. I could maybe clean some more stuff up, but I'm happy with this performance and glad to move on.
