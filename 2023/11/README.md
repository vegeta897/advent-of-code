I felt VERY good about this one. I coded my input parsing to handle the galaxy expansion in a way that made part 2 a total breeze. I was hoping for a sub-1k rank as a reward, but oh well. Relieved that no actual pathfinding algo was needed. The puzzle instructions were sneaky with that path demonstration. Also kind of sneaky about the off-by-one potential in "every empty row turns into 1000000 rows" rather than "every empty row adds 1000000 rows".
