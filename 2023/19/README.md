This was a good challenge. I was shocked when my part 2 code worked, because I was certain that there would be overlap between my possible "accept paths". But of course there isn't, each path has its own divergence, thus making them all mutually exclusive in the kind of parts they can take. So it was just a matter of using the conditions to narrow the `[min,max]` ranges for each part property and multiplying them together, then summing all those up.
