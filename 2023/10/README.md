Holy moly. This may not have been the hardest day, but it's certainly my most complex solution so far. I figured out a strategy pretty quick, but implementing it was a good amount of work. Scary the whole time because it felt so fragile, but amazingly it worked on the first try.

I don't feel like refactoring!
