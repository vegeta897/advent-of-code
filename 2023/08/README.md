I'm glad I did last year (specifically day 24), otherwise I might not have known how to act on the suspicion that there would be a period of repetition for each ghost moving through the nodes. What that means is every X steps, the ghost will be at the end. Once you know that for every ghost, you just find the least common multiple of them to get the answer.

I had to dig up the GCD and LCM functions from last year to help. And also write a function to handle an array of numbers instead of just 2 (thankfully you can just reduce it two at a time).

Rank #1976, which is a bit higher than I expected. I wonder if there's a faster brute force way? I wouldn't think the LCM route would come so easily to so many.
