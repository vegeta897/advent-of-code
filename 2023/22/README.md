I got tripped up by a lot here, including dumb things like falsey brick IDs and accessing sorted arrays by an unsorted index. The example input also lacks a special case that I had to imagine to realize it could trip up my code.

Part 2 was a bit simpler and I did it with a brute force, without even realizing it could be done by recursively traversing the list of supported bricks. So I rewrote my part 2 afterwards and cut down the run time to a tenth of what it was.
