Well this was harder than I'd expected. I had the right general idea but my execution was sloppy. I should have implemented proper pathfinding from the start, and I tripped up on a lot of silly bugs.

I overcomplicated my answer by pathing from every node to every node, when all that was needed a single node to every node. Possibly a little fragile, and it still runs slower than I'd like, but whatevs. Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ„
