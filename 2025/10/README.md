The big one has finally arrived.

After spending all night making only tiny optimizations to my brute-forcing, I kept at it the next day and didn't get much further.

So I looked on reddit and was discouraged by seeing that the "easy" solution involved using a linear algebra solver. I'm not intersted in that, so I looked at brute-force pruning solutions people posted. The one I went with was based around a concept I was sort of getting at in my own attempts.

Reading the Rust code was its own challenge but it helped that I could figure out what was going on. That part was important. If I couldn't solve this on my own, I wanted to learn from what I found and re-implemented.

I put all my old part 2 code in `failures.ts`.
