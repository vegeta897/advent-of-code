Okay, you got me.

The funny thing is that I had the correct answer at 21 minutes in. My instincts for doing sanity checks first were fully validated. I just didn't read my log correctly to see that they covered all cases, or didn't believe it.

I ended up writing a naive packing algorithm, which was kind of fun. I've left it in the solution, even though it doesn't even work on the example input.

This was a nice year of AoC. Mostly on the lighter side but still satisfying and fun, with one super hard one and a great ending.
